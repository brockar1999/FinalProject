What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project? 
	That I can make a point and click, I never thought about that before.
 

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?
	The fact that everyone needs comfort in these awful times and so do cats and dogs.
 

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?
	I just really want to make a point and click now!!!!
 

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?
	It seems all the plans you have listed are good ways to improve. I think, making the enemies'
	HP clearer would help. And adjusting the speed of the enemies compared to bullets, as they can 
	sometimes outrun them.
 

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?
	Not GDScript I don't think so... no?
 

Is it clear that every group member participated? 
	Yes
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE? 
	I can't find it
 

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
	Separate the sections & make use of markdown bold text, etc.
 

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.
	This was very very nice, I needed a soft fun game about adopting animals & sharing some love.
	Thank you so much!!!
